# Research Tryout: Visual Pipeline & Object Detection Comparison

This repository contains a project developed as part of my research tryout. The project focuses on generating images using a diffusion model, performing object detection on the generated images, and then comparing the original images with the annotated detections via a local web interface.

## Repository Structure

- **pipeline.ipynb**  
  A Jupyter Notebook that contains the complete pipeline:
  - A function to generate images using a diffusion model.
  - Object detection functions (using YOLOv5, Detectron2, with an ensemble approach) that annotate the images.
  - Code to save both the generated images and the annotated outputs.

- **generated_images/**  
  Contains sample images generated by the diffusion model.

- **Annotated_Detections/**  
  Contains sample annotated images produced by the object detection pipeline.

- **app.py**  
  A Flask web application that displays the generated images alongside the corresponding annotated images for side-by-side comparison.

## Features

- **Image Generation**  
  Uses a diffusion model (Stable Diffusion) to generate images from text prompts.

- **Object Detection**  
  Utilizes ensemble models to identify objects within the generated images. The detected objects are annotated with bounding boxes and labels.

- **Ensemble Detection (Optional)**  
  Combines the outputs of multiple detectorsto improve robustness.

- **Web Interface**  
  A local Flask server (`app.py`) enables easy visual comparison of the original generated images and their corresponding detection annotations.

## Setup & Installation

1. Run the pipline.ipynb on colab. (https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1oGQG7FzpXmFA8-33w2mpykAx8PrWKI9X?usp=sharing)
2. Run the app.py after cloning the repo to see differences side by side.

 ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ayush971107/research-tryout.git
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python3 app.py
